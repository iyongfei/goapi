﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿FloodUDPservice.xml,UDP Service Flood,"A very basic form of attack that can easily cause a DoS on most equipment. Sends out UDP traffic from random traffic sources. The UDP flood can DoS in two ways: 1) Saturates the queue of a device with connectionless UDP traffic, preventing legitimate connection oriented traffic to pass through. 2) This threat allows the user to adjust the target IP and port, possibly causing a DoS on the targets service or host operating system.",UDP,UDP,||$p ay lo ad||
